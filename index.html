            Billy McEntee is a Brooklyn-based writer. He’s a freelance <u id="journalism-link">arts journalist</u> (<i>The Boston Globe, The Washington Post</i>, <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, <i>Interview, Vanity Fair</i>) and <u id="theater-link">theatermaker</u> who recently co-created the extended, “recommended” (<i>Vulture</i>) play <i>The Voices in Your Head</i> at St. Lydia’s.
            <br><br>
            As Theater Editor of the <a target="_blank" href="https://brooklynrail.org/contributor/billy-mcentee/"><i>Brooklyn Rail</i></a>, Billy started Rail Shorts, a biannual series publishing mini-plays, and contributes monthly essays analyzing new works, particularly experimental plays with shorter runs that receive less coverage. These responses aim to crack open a play to reveal its dramaturgy, rigor, and intention. 
            <br><br>
            Billy was the inaugural Helbing Fellow for the American Theatre Critics Association. He also teaches with The School of The New York Times and is the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival’s director for the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kennedy-center.org/education/opportunities-for-artists/pre-professional-artist-training/kcactf/itja/">Institute of Theater Journalism and Advocacy</a>. Billy graduated cum laude from Boston College and loves his home state, New Jersey.

                A sold-out, extended, site-specific dark comedy, <i>The Voices in Your Head</i> is about a support group for people who share a bizarre bond.<br><br>

                “A bracing reminder of how exhilarating a show can be when it connects one person — onstage, in the audience — with the world.”<br> –<a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/theater/belarus-free-theater-the-ask-medea-revisited-voices-head.html">Elisabeth Vincentelli for <i>The New York Times</i></a><br><br>

                “Warm, witty, bonkers. If you need a morsel of sweet weirdness, acted by top-shelf Off-Off megastars, try <i>The Voices in Your Head</i>.”<br> –<a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/Helen_E_Shaw/status/1750269642516349329">Helen Shaw, <i>The New Yorker</i> critic</a><br><br>

                “The play eases you into the rhythms of its little community, pivots into wider ruminations on death, and then breaks into an energetic and cathartic finale.”<br> –<a target="_blank" href="assets/vulture-review.jpg">Jackson McHenry for <i>Vulture</i></a>
