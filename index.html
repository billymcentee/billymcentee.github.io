            A Greenpoint apartment, Sep–Oct 2025 
            <br>
            </b>   
                A sold-out and site-specific play starring Kyle Beltran and Adam Chanler-Berat, <i>Slanted Floors</i> invited an audience of six to witness the surreal in one freelancer’s day, share in the meal of two partners dining, dishing, and dreaming, and behold the un-remarkability of queer domesticity.<br><br>

                “Recommended — <i>Slanted Floors</i> gearshifts suddenly and miraculously into mysterious realms. Among plays I’ve seen this year, the haunting simplicity of this one’s closing image is tough to beat. I hope they keep doing this show for as long as they’re willing to keep making that soup.”<br> –<a target="_blank" href="assets/SF%20Review.png">Jackson McHenry (also on his Top 10 List for 2025) for <i>Vulture</i></a><br><br>

                “<i>Slanted Floors</i> is currently New York’s most unique and exclusive piece of theater and shows the power of evoking the ordinary to unpeel something profound.”<br> –<a target="_blank" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/slanted-floors-inside-new-yorks-most-exclusive-theater-show/?rand=2544438">Tim Teeman for <i>The Daily Beast</i></a><br><br>

                “In a year full of apartment shows, I particularly loved Billy McEntee's 'Slanted Floors,' staged in McEntee's own Greenpoint walkup, where Kyle Beltran and Adam Chanler-Berat played a couple trying to imagine utopia.”<br> –<a target="_blank" href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/2025-in-review/the-best-theatre-of-2025">Helen Shaw for <i>The New Yorker</i></a>

                A sold-out, extended, site-specific dark comedy, <i>The Voices in Your Head</i> is about a support group for people who share a bizarre bond. The play was nominated for the 2025 Drama Desk Award for Unique Theatrical Experience.<br><br>

                “A bracing reminder of how exhilarating a show can be when it connects one person — onstage, in the audience — with the world.”<br> –<a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/theater/belarus-free-theater-the-ask-medea-revisited-voices-head.html">Elisabeth Vincentelli for <i>The New York Times</i></a><br><br>

                “Warm, witty, bonkers. If you need a morsel of sweet weirdness, acted by top-shelf Off-Off megastars, try <i>The Voices in Your Head</i>.”<br> –<a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/Helen_E_Shaw/status/1750269642516349329">Helen Shaw, <i>The New Yorker</i> critic</a><br><br>

                “The play eases you into the rhythms of its little community, pivots into wider ruminations on death, and then breaks into an energetic and cathartic finale.”<br> –<a target="_blank" href="assets/vulture-review.jpg">Jackson McHenry for <i>Vulture</i></a>
